rust-syntax-test
================

Goal of this project is to provide a Rust source file that exercises most
language features, so it can be used in the development of syntax
highlighters.


## Status ##

WIP.


## Known bugs ##

Besides the intended purpose, the program can be built but it is silly,
sub-optimal, and not very pretty.
